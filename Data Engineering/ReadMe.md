# Data Engineering

Data engineers primarily focus on :

- Build and maintain the organizationâ€™s data pipeline systems

- Clean and wrangle data into a usable state

As a data scientist, you will work closely with them and should understand what they are doing.
Sometimes, a same person can be a data scientist but also a data engineer.

The repository will just be like a list of flashcard to understand and be familiar with data infrastructure.
