- fast and handle big dataset
- scales well in embedding dimension
- can be used as a dimension reduction or a clustering tool
- performs better at preserving aspects of global structure of the data than t-SNE
- supports a wide variety of distance functions (more than just euclidian distance)
- supports adding new points to an existing embedding via the standard sklearn transform method
- supports supervised and semi-supervised dimension reduction
